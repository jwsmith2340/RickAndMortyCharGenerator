# Rick an Morty Random Character Generator

This app generates a random iteration of characters, episodes, or locations in the Rick and Morty universe. In keeping with the spirit of the show, when you search for a character, you could return any version from the multiverse. So, search for Rick a few times in a row and see which versions you end up with. Likewise, search for earth a few times, and see which characters are from that version of earth. You can also see which characters were featured in each episode from the episodes page.
